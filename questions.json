    "correctAnswer": "ω = ∇ × u",
    "explanation": "Vorticity is defined as the curl of the velocity field, ω = ∇×u. This follows directly from the lecture’s definition (see Citation 1 and 2)."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "They are always tangent to the local velocity vector.",
    "explanation": "Vortex lines are defined as curves that are everywhere tangent to the vorticity vector; since ω = ∇×u, they are also tangent to the local velocity in a fluid with non‑zero vorticity. They do not exist in irrotational flow or stationary fluid (Citation 2)."
